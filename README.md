# RimworldDevelopmentStuff
Just a collection of useful stuff I've made or pulled from other sources and edited heavily for my Rimworld modding environment. Nothing is guaranteed to work, the repo is not laid out in any particular way and I've only made it public because someone else may find it useful too. Make sure you know what you're doing with these things and why first though. 

- Batch script for deploying a mod to rimworld from a development location (Heavily based on Brainzzz' original but edited for my prefered style. I use it in all of my projects.
- Batch script for doing a bunch of tedious file hopping crap to turn dev mode on and off, make backups and copy mods (that bit doesn't work yet). I use it whenever I need breakpoint support atm.
