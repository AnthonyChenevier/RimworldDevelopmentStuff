# RimworldDevelopmentStuff
Just a collection of useful stuff I've made or pulled from other sources and edited heavily for my Rimworld modding environment. Nothing is guaranteed to work, the repo is not laid out in any particular way and I've only made it public because someone else may find it useful too. Make sure you know what you're doing with these things and why first though. 

- Batch script for deploying a mod to rimworld from a development location (Heavily based on Brainzzz' original but edited for my prefered style.
- Batch script for doing a bunch of tedious file hopping crap to turn dev mode on and off, make backups and copy mods (that bit doesn't work yet).
- VS Rimworld mod project template - I think this is up to date and can just be installed like any other VS template. You'd have to look for a tutorial if you don't know how to do that.
- Debugging symbols for Assembly-CSharp.dll & Assembly-CSharp-firstpass.dll. Gonna try and keep this one up to date because I haven't seen a working repo that offers ones for 2022.
- Rambles about debugging stuff.
