How to enable debugging for rimworld
1. get the version of unity used to build this version of rimworld
2. extract/copy UnityPlayer.dll, WindowsPlayer.exe and WinPix???.dll from the unity folder's 64bit dev variation
3. paste the 3 files into rimworld directory, backing up originals first. 
4. edit boot.config in rimworld/RimWorldWin64_Data and add the lines 'wait-for-managed-debugger=1' and 'player-connection-debug=1'
These steps will allow you you set breakpoints in VS with Unity development tools for your own mod, but will not let you create breakpoints in decompiled source (Test this). 
The following steps will enable setting breakpoints and debugging compiled rimworld code as well:
5. Decompile and/or generate a pdb for Assembly-CSharp.dll using dotpeek. Haven't had luck with other tools.
6. place the generated pdb alongside the dll, as well as a file name Assembly-CSharp.ini, with the contents:

[.NET Framework Debugging Control]
GenerateTrackingInfo=1
AllowOptimize=0

7. set up Visual studio to handle these symbols properly - should just work, but may need to load symbols during debug using the Debug > Windows > Modules screen
